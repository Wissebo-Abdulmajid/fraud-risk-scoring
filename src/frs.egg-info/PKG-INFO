# Fraud / Risk Scoring System with Calibration

A production-adjacent tabular ML system that outputs **calibrated fraud/risk probabilities** and a **decision policy**
(review / block / approve) using **cost-sensitive thresholding** and **error analysis**.

## What this is
- Train + evaluate a tabular classifier
- Calibrate probabilities (Platt / isotonic)
- Select thresholds under cost / review-capacity constraints
- Generate reproducible artifacts + reports
- Batch scoring via CLI

## What this is NOT
- Not an enterprise platform (no Kafka/feature store)
- Not a claim of perfect fraud detection (labels are noisy + adversarial)
- Not “AI magic”; the repo emphasizes limitations and honest evaluation

## Quickstart (will be implemented)
```bash
frs train --config configs/base.yaml
frs evaluate --run-dir runs/<run_id>
frs score --run-dir runs/<run_id> --input data/sample/sample.csv --output scored.csv
